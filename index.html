        <p>I have recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics this past spring 2021. The way my resume and past experiences were laid out built a pathway with a bright neon sign pointing towards a career teaching Mathematics. I unconsciously followed this pathway all my academic journey hoping that the voices of societal and cultural expectations would lead me to discover my purpose and identity. Yet the more energy I put into fueling these expectations, the further I felt away from finding the answers. It was when I graduated, I decided to step into the dreadful gray area that didn't know what I would like to do moving forward. </p>
        <p>From the educational route to the financial route, I had too many career options that overwhelmed my mind with the fear of regretting the career I chose. That was when I began researching career paths, interviewing individuals in different careers, and journaling my strengths and weaknesses to organize my strengths, values, and goals. After 4 months of problem-solving, I narrowed down my options to two potential careers: an accountant or a software engineer. Becoming an accountant would have taught me important life skills such as taxes, economics, audits, and communication skills; but the downside was that I would have to go back to school in order to get the 60-course credit requirements to become certified (then I would have to study for intensive exams). I would be investing a lot of time to get an accountant certification.</p>
